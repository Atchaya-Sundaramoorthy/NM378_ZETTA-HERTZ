     the crops and its' details.  They are manually searching for crop details.  In this feature, the captured image or uploaded 
     images can be classified based on the dataset given.  The crop's age is predicted and the application also detects
     the current location of the user and upload it on the local database (sql) and firebase.  In case of capturing in one 
     location, and uploading in another location, a feature to change the location is provided.
